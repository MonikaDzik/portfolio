# My Tester's Portfolio

## About me  [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-dzik-wro-test76aa/)
My name is Monika and I am a beginner tester who bravely enters the IT world. Looking for a new career path, I started reading about the work of a software tester. It turned out that I have most of the personality traits of a good tester.

By completing the basic training and obtaining the ***ISTQB certificate FL***, I want to show my commitment for gaining practical skills in a new profession. I have a **curiosity** to understand how things work, and I find it very interesting to be part of the software development process.

I have experience in working with clients and in the development of documentation. I am a **fast learner** and am used to being part of a good team.

Personal development and gaining experience in new skills are my next goals that I set for myself.  I am looking for a company that will give me a chance to do so.
