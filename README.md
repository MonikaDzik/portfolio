# My Tester's Portfolio
# abaut me
I am a beginner tester who bravely enters the IT world. By completing the basic training and obtaining the _ISTQB certificate_, I want to show reliable preparation for gaining practical skills in a new profession.
Personal development and gaining experience in new skills are my next goals that I set for myself. I hope that employment in your company will allow me to do so.
