# My Tester's Portfolio
## About me
My name is Monika and I am a beginner tester who bravely enters the IT world. By completing the basic training and obtaining the __ISTQB certificate FL__, I want to show reliable preparation for gaining practical skills in a new profession.

I have experience in working with clients and in the development of documentation

Personal development and gaining experience in new skills are my next goals that I set for myself.  I am looking for a company that will give me a chance to do so.
